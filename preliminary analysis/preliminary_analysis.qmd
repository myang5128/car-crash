## Introduction 

### The Data Set
This data set is publicly available online and can be found here ('https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data'). This data set contains all information regarding motor vehicle incidents in New York City based on the MV104-AN police report. This report is only required when there are injuries, casualties, or if the total cost of damages exceeds $1000. As a result, the data may not contain information about minor incidents like fender benders where there usually aren't injuries or a significant worth of damage.

### The Question
The purpose of this analysis is to show the relationship between several factors that cause car crashes in New York City. There are many factors that can affect the severity of vehicle incidents like location and the time of day.If we could find a common factor in deadly incidents, we then could focus proactive efforts in preventing or limiting said incidents. New York City is one of the largest metropolitan areas and has millions of drivers. We need to be able to ensure safety for those motorists, their passengers, and pedestrians.

## Data Preparation

### Prepping the Data
The original data set at the time of retrieval (September 22, 2024) contained more than 2 million entries and 29 columns. These columns include crash information like the number of people killed or injured, the location, the date, and more. However, to simplify the data set that we're working with, we want to eliminate some redundant information. We got rid of all the columns that did not provide more insight on the incident or factors leading to it. We need to also make sure that our data set contains entries that have their information available, i.e. their columns are not unknown or missing. Another factor that we want to consider is the time of day (morning, midday, evening, and night). To do this (and to not constantly refer back to the time of the crash), we want to create a new variable that contains the time of day based on when the crash happened. Since there is no universally accepted time frame, we decided to split the day into four equal sections. Morning would be from 5AM to 11AM, midday would be from 11AM to 5PM, evening would be from 5PM to 11PM, and night would be from 11PM to 5AM. After both the cleaning and adding to our new data set, we have about 1.3 million entries with 19 columns each.
